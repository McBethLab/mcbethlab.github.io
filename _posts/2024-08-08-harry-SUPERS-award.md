I’m excited to share that I won the Dr. Stephen W. Tuttle Research Award for my final presentation titled “Generating Deliverable Radiotherapy Plans with Diffusion Models” in SUPERS@PENN 24’ hosted by the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. This award is given annually to the two best final presentations in this program, and I’m honored to be one of the recipients this year.
